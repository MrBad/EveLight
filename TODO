- consolidate Entity class/system:
    - use QuadTree for it.
    - Entity should not extend MultiSprite. Probably it should not know
        about how it is drawn on screen.
        It should CONTAIN something like Renderable class.

- QuadTree can be more generic; instead of constrain on using AABB/GetAABB
    in QTEntity interface, I can rewrite the QTEntity to have few methods like:
        QTEntity::FitsIn, QTEntity::Intersect, QTEntity::GetBoundary
        (?! for growing up the tree). 
        This way, we can use points and lines inside it.

+ Window class has some not consistent methods - getWidth(), getHeight().
    It should probably be GetWidth(), GetHeight().

- move EveLight library in a separate folder and add a namespace for it. 
    namespace evl can be a nice short name.

- use FreeType fonts for Texter and not a png texture.

- how about running it on Windows... Yeah...

- write documentation for the library. Move the programs that is using EveLight
    in a demo folder.
